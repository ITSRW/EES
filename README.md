The design idea of the software mainly comes from the problems found in the use of personal devices.The use of networked devices in the public network area may lead to the risk of theft when unattended. In order to reduce the risk, a simple monitoring system of pc-pe / PC docking mode is designed.Run the "pulse" program on the monitored device to send the monitoring status signal to the designated IP in the intranet, and the monitoring terminal continuously receives the signal and confirms the normal status of the monitored device. When the monitored end is disconnected from the intranet by abnormal means without entering the password to release the monitoring, the monitoring end will not receive the status confirmation signal. After this situation lasts for ten seconds, the monitoring end will start to alarm.
